# Website | Teams-directory 🖥️

The official website for Magnesium!

## Purpose

This branch serves as data-storage point for the team-page, so commits can be made directly to this repo, without having to access the main website-branch.

## How to

Simply open up the `data/team.json`-file and edit the contents of that.

Add the image for the team-members to the `data/images/`-folder. The website supports JPG/JPEG, GIF, PNG and WEBP. (It may support other types, but these 4 are mainly 100% stable)
